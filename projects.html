                        <h5>Unit Change Process</h5>
                        <p>When I started working at the School of Management, students were required to download/print or email unit change request. I automated the process using a Microsoft form and Power Automate, this could allow for data to be automatically stored in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
                        <p>Processing unit changes was a time consuming task, using Power Automate to send an adaptive card to a Teams area, where the outcome email could be sent automatically, with additional notes, to students more than halved the processing time.<p>
                        <p>Students received an automatic email confirming their choice which reduced any additional incoming messages.<p>
                        
                        <h5>Extension Process</h5>
                        <p>I created a similar process for the extension requests, however this was a more complex project as each case had to be sent to different teams, I used the switch method in Power Automate to accomplish this.<p>
                        <p>I presented my solution to the Director of Teaching, Director of Studies and programme team, my solution was implemented and has been running for over 2 years.</p>
                        <p>This process has reduced workload and loss of information or missed requests.</p>
